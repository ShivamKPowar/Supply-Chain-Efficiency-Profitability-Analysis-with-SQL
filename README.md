# Supply-Chain-Efficiency-Profitability-Analysis-with-SQL
# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The objective of this initiative is to examine supply chain information utilizing SQL for the purpose of revealing trends, areas of inefficiency, and prospects for enhancement. Through the structuring and verification of authentic data, it furnishes practical observations on stock quantities, supplier effectiveness, transportation arrangements, and financial returns. The primary aim is to support organizations in optimizing procedures, cutting down expenses, and improving decision-making processes. The plan is crafted to seamlessly merge with visualization software such as Power BI for the creation of interactive reports and the formulation of data-centric strategic plans.
# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
1. Analyze Inventory Levels:
   Identify products running low on stock and calculate average stock levels to optimize reorder strategies.
2. Evaluate Supplier Performance
   Measure lead times, defect rates, and cost contributions to select reliable and cost-effective suppliers.
3. Assess Sales and Profitability
   Calculate revenue, profit margins, and best-selling products to guide pricing and marketing strategies.
4. Optimize Warehouse and Logistics Operations
   Analyze shipping modes, routes, and costs to enhance delivery efficiency and reduce operational expenses.
5. Gain Market Insights
   Explore regional performance and cost efficiency to identify growth opportunities and target markets.
